Website Landing Page for The Odin Project

**Project Overview**
This landing page project is designed to showcase a simple, clean, and user-friendly layout. The goal is to build a visually appealing homepage that introduces visitors to the website or product, provides essential information, and encourages users to take action (like signing up or exploring the site further).

For this project, I focused on:

- Using basic HTML for structure and content.
- Styling the page with CSS (including Flexbox).
- Navigation bar: A simple and clean navigation menu that links to different sections of the page.
- Hero section: A large introductory section with a background image and a call to action (CTA).
- Information sections: Sections that provide key information about the product or service being showcased.
-Footer: A footer with useful links and contact information.

**Tech Stack**
This landing page was built using the following technologies:

HTML: The basic building blocks of the web, used to structure the content of the page.
CSS: Used for styling the page and creating a modern, visually appealing design.
Flexbox for layout.
